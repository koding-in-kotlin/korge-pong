# Super plan

## First session: first steps

- [x] cloned the project
- [x] made a circle that bounces

## Second session: single jumpy ball

- [x] change something on border collision
- [x] change velocity when pressing keyboard buttons
- [x] store velocity as a individual property of the circle

## Third session: multiple jumpy balls

- [x] instantiate circles properly
- [x] Ideal Gas route
    - [x] add multiple circles
    - [x] have a way to store velocities of circles of different colors

## Fourth session: adding and removing ~balls~ particles on demand

- [x] bugfix directions
- [x] have a keypress that adds a particle to the box
- [x] have a keypress that deletes a particle from the box

## Fifth session: 2d gas particles movement

- [x] introduce horizontal velocity and bounce of sides
- [x] maybe bounce particles from each other as well
- [x] Ideal Gas route
  - [x] start colliding
  - [x] direction as vector

## Sixth session: "More" realistic collisions

- [x] add masses
- [x] do the elastic collision
- [x] collide with walls non-elastically
- [x] account for ~size~ mass difference when colliding

## Seventh session: FIX COLLISIONS FOR GOOOOOD

- [x] fix collisions to make them account for Gas Particle centers
- [x] have a text with energy inside the scene (some sort of UI)
- [x] Don't get stuck in the walls
- [x] Fix annoying color palette
- [x] Fix the bug with speedup

## Ninth session:

- [x] Attach speed vectors to particles

## Next
- [ ] Show them on click
- [ ] Replace Line with Rect
- [ ] Debug weird collisions

## Brave New World

- [ ] velocity-based color?
   - [ ] check dataclasses
   - [ ] make benchmarks, probably runtime-dependent
- [ ] Continue with one ball
   - [ ] add gravity or some sort of acceleration
   - [ ] change something else like add air friction
- [ ] Two-body problem? Three-body problems?
- [ ] Make a platformer
- [ ] Add joystick
